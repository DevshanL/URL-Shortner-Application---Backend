# URL-Shortner-Application---Backend
Implementing a URL shortening service is not a complex task, and it is often part of system design interviews. In this post, I will try to explain the process of implementing the service. A URL shortener is a service that is used to create short links from very long URLs. Usually, short links have the size of one-third or even one-fourth of the original URL, which makes them easier to type, present, or tweet. Clicking on a short link user will be automatically redirected to the original URL. There are many URL shortening services available online, like tiny.cc, bitly.com, cutt.ly, etc.
